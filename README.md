# My Anki decks / memory flash cards


[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free and open-source flashcard program that utilizes spaced repetition (to increase rate of memorization). "Anki" (暗記) is the Japanese word for "memorization". The cards are presented using HTML and may include text, images, sounds, videos, and LaTeX equations. The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open SQLite format.

One can easily install the Windows / Linux destop app from the official website and practice in few minutes ! There is also an Android App :)

A community has shared a lot of Decks [HERE](https://ankiweb.net/decks/) in lots of languages & on all kind of subjects !
