An exhaustive Python cheat sheet 1/2

You'll find in this anki deck a summary of the most important key features of the Python programming language in order to help you memorizing it. 

Its clear syntax is illustrated trough simple examples. I'll probably make an other cheat sheet in the future with a focus on the Object Oriented part of Python and on functionnal programming. You can find all of this content in a dedicated [jupyter notebook]() or as [a blogpost on my personnal website]().
